Django
------

This blog post does a really good job comparing the two most popular python web
frameworks out there currently, Django and Flask.
Written only a couple months
ago, it breaks down the two framework into numerous categories including various
features, security, forms, flexibility, etc. It does a side by side comparison
between the two frameworks inside each category and talks about the advantages
and disadvantages of each. In this source I will focus on the advantages of
Django and why it is the most popular python web framework, but also include
the disadvantages of Django and why it is hard to get up and working.

This article, written by a python developer that uses Django, describes why
Django
has become the most popular python web framework to use. She talks about big,
popular websites that are built on Django, how Django's architecture gives
Django a big advantage in ease of use, and various advantages and disadvantages
using Django. What I can pull out from this source is examples of
websites that are built on Django and how Django's architecture enables Django
to be a fast, efficient web framework for complex web applications.

This article on Django was written awhile ago, but covers a general
overview of the Django framework and outlines many key parts. It talks about
features included in Django out-of-the-box including libraries, admin interface,
web security, and session management system that has ability for logins/logouts.
What I will focus on in this paper is the out-of-the-box features Django has
especially for security against most common web-attacks like cross-site
scripting, cross-site request forgeries, and SQL-injection.

This book is a general overview over Django and the many different libraries
and features the Django has and can perform. The book starts out with how to
setup and install Django. Then the book goes into how to start a new project
and works its way to production of your web application. What I am focusing on
in the book is chapters 2-3, which focus on creating a new project with Django
and being about to print "Hello World" with your new web app. What one finds is
that it is very complicated to get to the step of printing "Hello World" using
Django compared to other tools.

This conference talk from DjangoCon 2019 was over the Django ORM. The
speaker begins by describing tips and tricks on how to use Django ORM to run
queries on your data in your database without using Raw SQL. The speaker then
goes on and talks about how Django ORM can handle complex queries including
subqueries and window functions. From this talk I can use his many examples of
queries he makes using Django ORM and show how raw SQL code is not needed to
access data from your database.
