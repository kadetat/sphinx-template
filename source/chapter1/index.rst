============

This article over Django was written awhile ago, but covers a general
overview of the Django framework and outlines many key parts. It talks about
features included in Django out-of-the-box including libraries, admin interface,
web security, and session management system that has ability for logins/logouts.
What I will focus on in this paper is the out-of-the-box features Django has
especially for security against most common web-attacks like cross-site
scripting, cross-site request forgeries, and SQL-injection.
