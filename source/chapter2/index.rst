Django: Web Development with Python
===================================

This book is a general overview over Django and the many different libraries
and features the Django has and can perform. The book starts out with how to
setup and install Django. Then the book goes into how to start a new project
and works its way to production of your web application. What I am focusing on
in the book is chapters 2-3, which focus on creating a new project with Django
and being about to print "Hello World" with your new web app. What one finds is
that it is very complicated to get to this step using Django compared to other
tools.
